📊 Market Analysis Dashboard : 

This project presents a comprehensive Market Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to evaluate product conversion trends, social media engagement, and customer sentiment over three years (2023–2025). The project uses data imported from a .bak file into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), followed by transformation and visualization in Power BI.

📁 Project Workflow
Data Extraction: Downloaded and restored a .bak file into SSMS to explore and manipulate raw market data using SQL queries.
Data Transformation: Cleaned and prepared data (e.g., date formatting, null removal, aggregation) within SSMS for seamless integration into Power BI.
Data Visualization: Imported transformed data into Power BI and built four interactive dashboards to reflect different aspects of the market journey:
